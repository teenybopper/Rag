They often have a sturdy frame and a soft, padded mattress.\\n\\n**Features:** Cots may include features such as:\\n\\n* A removable, washable mattress cover\\n* A canopy or mosquito net to keep insects out\\n* Storage baskets or shelves for toys and essentials\\n* A mobile or toy attachment for entertainment\\n\\n**Types:** There are several types of cots, including:\\n\\n* Standard cots: Basic, rectangular cots with a flat surface\\n* Convertible cots: Can be converted into a toddler bed or a daybed\\n* Travel cots: Lightweight, portable cots designed for travel or outdoor use\\n* Bassinet cots: Smaller, more compact cots designed for newborns\\n\\n**Benefits:** Cots provide a safe and comfortable sleeping environment for young children, helping to promote healthy sleep habits and reduce the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).
